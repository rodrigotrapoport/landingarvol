                        Mainque, department of
                        General Roca, province of Rio Negro, with a river coast and land on the steppe and desert. We
                        are in our initial stage,
                        convening investors, people and organizations interested in building a sustainable, fair,

                        The project is to found an avant-garde eco-sustainable town, with advanced organic and
                        biodynamic agroecological production,
                        regenerating soils with CO2 recapture, offering top quality and healthy food with education and
                        comprehensive health.
                        We are strongly committed to the environment, which is why it is essential to generate new ways
                        of living in society
                        and to produce clean and renewable energy. Solar panels and other clean forms of power
                        generation will be installed.
                        We will promote the movement of people from the big city to rural areas by offering new real
                        estate developments
                        that take care of the environment, promoting sustainability in all areas, value chains in

                    <p class="text-success">The mission is to strengthen the development of small neighboring towns
                        through decent work,
                        agroecological production, and the development of healthy technologies for people, the
                        environment and socially responsible.
                        We will promote soil regeneration using cutting-edge technology and renewable energy in
                        production
                        (windmills, solar and hydraulic pumps, and ponds), developing new ecological strategies in
                        irrigation, weed management,
                        pests, and fertilization. We will develop an ecological commune with sustainable housing
                        (low-impact materials)
                        and innovative systems for caring for the environment at the energy level, waste collection and
                        recycling, waste management
                        and use of water resources. In the social aspect, decent and autonomous work and housing will be
                        promoted with a new
                        concept of town, where people who share a common interest in lifestyle, social and environmental
                        responsibility coexist
                        with diverse areas of expertise to develop the area. It will allow low-income families to access
                        their own land, forming
                        part of a cooperative. This model admits that each person can contribute what they have:
                        knowledge, financing, workforce
                        or profession, equalizing opportunities and favoring interdisciplinary and horizontal work. A
                        bridge will be built linking
                        the commune of Mainque and route 22 with the area, favoring the productive growth of the fence,
                        facilitating transportation
                        for the inhabitants with even greater regional development, favoring the migration of people and
                        sustainable productive
                        development in this region. depopulated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-success">The economic model is carried out prioritizing the welfare of the worker,
                        their growth and development,
                        favoring identification with the project and rooting in the region. There are 4,000 hectares
                        allocated for organic agricultural
                        production of fruit trees, nuts, olive trees, vineyards, vegetables, seeds and cereals, with
                        more than 40 different varieties.
                        Sowing agriculture will be complemented by the planting of fruit trees, nuts and medicinal
                        herbs, generating economic,
                        environmental and social sustainability. The project includes the production of a wide variety
                        of organic, vegan and vegetarian
                        processed products. They have been designed based on our knowledge of the market, the needs of
                        consumers, together with the
                        culture of each country of destination. Two industrial plants are proposed for the production of
                        processed foods and organic
                        beverages, in accordance with the growing global demand for healthy products. One third of the
                        organic agricultural inputs needed
                        for the production of food and beverages will be developed and produced by the project itself.
                        The other two thirds will be
                        independent producers in the region, favoring the development of small regional economies. Its
                        commercialization will be to
                        satisfy the demand of consumers in Latin America and the Asian continent. By opting for the use
                        of renewable energy, the variable
                        costs of irrigation are eliminated, which usually involves a great risk and in turn generates
                        greater profitability. Finally,
                        the sale of lots financed for 30 years will be an additional contribution to the financing of
                        the project, ensuring the profitability
                        of the land for a sustained period over time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-success">A school and a comprehensive health center will be built that will provide
                        quality services
                        (in a place where they do not exist), favoring integration, generating training and an
                        additional source of income.
                        Finally, some 400 hectares will be developed for the sale of lots, in which ecological housing
                        will be offered in a
                        natural context, promoting the migration of professionals from the city to rural areas,
                        promoting teleworking and
                        improving connectivity, with the development of new green cities integrated in community life.
