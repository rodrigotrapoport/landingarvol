						School of Regenerative Agriculture with community support in Vosqe Lawen
					</h6>

						<img class="img-fluid" src="./images/chile.png" alt="Lawen Chile">
					</a>
					<p class="text-success">
						School is the place where I do what I like when I am happy and calm. This is Vosqe Lawen.
						There are 50 hectares dedicated to the regenerative agriculture of life. Happy and calm we go
						through life,
						working with our community to have more and better food. Sharing and enriching the wisdom of
						connecting with nature.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						We develop regenerative technology that allows us to produce nutritious food and healing plants.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						This project consists of the construction of a place with bioconstruction technology, friendly
						to the landscape
						and that works with sustainable energy systems. A space for meetings, training, artistic
						activities. A place that
						offers food made with food that is produced in the field and that does not lose its nutritional
						quality.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						There will also be a soil and food chromatography laboratory that will allow us to see their
						nutritional
						quality through colors.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						The chromatography presented in this learning space allows to determine, in a qualitative and
						simple way,
						the life of the soil and its relationship between minerals, microbiology, organic matter,
						humification,
						soil carbon, imbalances and balances, soil respiration, toxic residues, among others. others.
						The patterns have been established by several researchers, mainly E. Pfeiffer, and correspond to
						the analysis of soils, organic fertilizers and humus, in order to facilitate the interpretation
						of the chromas.
						From this, the methodology and criteria pre-established by E. Pfeiffer have been considered, to
						determine
						the parameters for the interpretation of the soils that pioneers of organic agriculture such as
						Jairo
						Restrepo and Sebastian Pinheiro have shared and promoted throughout the world.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						We will also develop protection techniques, improvement of soil fertility and Successional
						Agroforestry
						Systems (SAFSs). This includes topics like:
						PROTECTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF SOIL FERTILITY. This contemplates the construction of agrolevels,
						thread level, ridge level, Design of the protected plot, Determination of the slope, soil depth,
						Main line and estimation of the distances between protection structures, Tracing of the contour
						lines,
						Correction and marking of contour lines, for the construction of soil protection structures.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						ESTABLISHMENT OF SOIL PROTECTION TECHNIQUES. Construction of soil protection
						techniques with locally available materials; Stone walls (pircas), living barriers, based on
						straw,
						bushes (falaris, broom) and other combined techniques; infiltration and crowning ditches, soil
						preparation and tillage, minimum tillage, use of animal manure, improvement of pens to maintain
						manure fertility
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">
						SUCCESSIONAL AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS (SAFS). Processes of ¨soil formation¨,
						explanatory model, Diagnosis of the current situation of the production systems in the area,
						Re-knowing the principles of the natural eco-system, experiences and results of the successional
						çagroforestry systems, Dry design of the systems successional agroforestry, taking into account
						the identified principles; Diversity, coverage, strata, consortia, minimum tillage,
						Establishment of the plot in SAFS, Selective weeding activities and synchronized pruning
						(after the establishment of the plot based on its development), Elaboration of SAFS on flip
						charts,
						Establishment of polycultures, Selective weeding and complementation of sowings, Synchronized
						pruning,
						Dry and live covers, in the plots, Importance of water in agricultural production.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">It includes a center for the production of bio-preparations that will
						constantly be researching and innovating in the production and use of products that improve
						the life of the soil.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">Production techniques for crops protected under greenhouses and heating
						systems, this intended for the production of seedlings that will later go to a nursery to
						finish their development or the definitive plantation. This includes the rescue of native
						berries, ancient fruits, edible mushrooms and medicinal plants.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">For all this we need the collaboration of bees as pollinators.
						That is why an apiary with organic and biodynamic management will be developed.
					</p>
					<p class="text-success">A laboratory will be implemented to study insects and their biological
						cycles to find out how we work with them.</p>
					<h6 class="text-success">School for the dissemination of regenerative technology with the
						communities</h6>
					<p class="text-success">Technical teams and producers linked to State development programs will
						participate in this school. The Municipality of Vilcún, together with the technical team of the
						Vosqe Lawen School, will select producers according to their attitude and productive aptitude
						so that they can implement regenerative agriculture techniques in their productive systems and
						be able to organize a SPG Participatory Management System to access Chilean organic
						certification.
