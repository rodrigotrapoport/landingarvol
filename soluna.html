          <p class="text-success">Located in a beautiful natural environment, with native forests and native flora, 
            which invites you to live in the wild landscape. In Mainque, on the Rio Negro, Patagonia, Argentina.
          </p>
          <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/5/edit?mid=1Lga1ZfkZQuKKoNOcAhFOq9qZPtE3e-0&usp=sharing" target="_blank">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/soluna.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <p class="text-success">Vosqe Soluna is a project in a field of 10,000 hectares near the town of Mainque, department of 
            General Roca, province of Rio Negro, with a river coast and land on the steppe and desert. We are in our initial stage, 
            convening investors, people and organizations interested in building a sustainable, fair, ecological and healthy reality. 
            The project is to found an avant-garde eco-sustainable town, with advanced organic and biodynamic agroecological production, 
            regenerating soils with CO2 recapture, offering top quality and healthy food with education and comprehensive health. 
            We are strongly committed to the environment, which is why it is essential to generate new ways of living in society 
            and to produce clean and renewable energy. Solar panels and other clean forms of power generation will be installed. 
            We will promote the movement of people from the big city to rural areas by offering new real estate developments 
            that take care of the environment, promoting sustainability in all areas, value chains in micro-regions, 
            education and comprehensive health.
          </p>
          <p class="text-success">The mission is to strengthen the development of small neighboring towns through decent work, 
            agroecological production, and the development of healthy technologies for people, the environment and socially responsible. 
            We will promote soil regeneration using cutting-edge technology and renewable energy in production 
            (windmills, solar and hydraulic pumps, and ponds), developing new ecological strategies in irrigation, weed management, 
            pests, and fertilization. We will develop an ecological commune with sustainable housing (low-impact materials) 
            and innovative systems for caring for the environment at the energy level, waste collection and recycling, waste management 
            and use of water resources. In the social aspect, decent and autonomous work and housing will be promoted with a new 
            concept of town, where people who share a common interest in lifestyle, social and environmental responsibility coexist 
            with diverse areas of expertise to develop the area. It will allow low-income families to access their own land, forming 
            part of a cooperative. This model admits that each person can contribute what they have: knowledge, financing, workforce 
            or profession, equalizing opportunities and favoring interdisciplinary and horizontal work. A bridge will be built linking 
            the commune of Mainque and route 22 with the area, favoring the productive growth of the fence, facilitating transportation 
            for the inhabitants with even greater regional development, favoring the migration of people and sustainable productive 
            development in this region. depopulated.
          </p>
          <p class="text-success">The economic model is carried out prioritizing the welfare of the worker, their growth and development, 
            favoring identification with the project and rooting in the region. There are 4,000 hectares allocated for organic agricultural 
            production of fruit trees, nuts, olive trees, vineyards, vegetables, seeds and cereals, with more than 40 different varieties. 
            Sowing agriculture will be complemented by the planting of fruit trees, nuts and medicinal herbs, generating economic, 
            environmental and social sustainability. The project includes the production of a wide variety of organic, vegan and vegetarian 
            processed products. They have been designed based on our knowledge of the market, the needs of consumers, together with the 
            culture of each country of destination. Two industrial plants are proposed for the production of processed foods and organic 
            beverages, in accordance with the growing global demand for healthy products. One third of the organic agricultural inputs needed 
            for the production of food and beverages will be developed and produced by the project itself. The other two thirds will be 
            independent producers in the region, favoring the development of small regional economies. Its commercialization will be to 
            satisfy the demand of consumers in Latin America and the Asian continent. By opting for the use of renewable energy, the variable 
            costs of irrigation are eliminated, which usually involves a great risk and in turn generates greater profitability. Finally, 
            the sale of lots financed for 30 years will be an additional contribution to the financing of the project, ensuring the profitability 
            of the land for a sustained period over time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-success">A school and a comprehensive health center will be built that will provide quality services 
            (in a place where they do not exist), favoring integration, generating training and an additional source of income. 
            Finally, some 400 hectares will be developed for the sale of lots, in which ecological housing will be offered in a 
            natural context, promoting the migration of professionals from the city to rural areas, promoting teleworking and 
            improving connectivity, with the development of new green cities integrated in community life.
